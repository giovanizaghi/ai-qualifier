## 🐛 Known Limitations

### 1. **No Pagination**
- Results page loads all prospects at once
- Could be slow for large batches (>50)
- **Recommendation**: Add pagination or virtual scrolling

### 2. **No Export**
- No CSV/Excel export functionality
- Users can't download results
- **Recommendation**: Add export button

### 3. **No Filtering**
- Can't filter by domain name or company
- Can't sort by different criteria
- **Recommendation**: Add search and sort controls

### 4. **No Edit/Delete**
- Can't edit prospect results
- Can't delete individual results
- **Recommendation**: Add management actions

### 5. **Single ICP per Company**
- Dashboard only shows first ICP
- Can't switch between multiple ICPs easily
- **Recommendation**: Add ICP selector
