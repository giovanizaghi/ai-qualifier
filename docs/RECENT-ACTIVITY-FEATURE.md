# Recent Activity Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Commit:** `3c74f4d` - feat: Add recent activity feature to dashboard

## Overview

Successfully implemented a Recent Activity section on the dashboard that displays the user's latest qualification runs with detailed status information, progress tracking, and quick access to results.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/qualify/recent`

**Location:** `src/app/api/qualify/recent/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Fetches up to 10 most recent qualification runs for authenticated users
- Returns all run statuses (COMPLETED, PROCESSING, PENDING, FAILED)
- Includes associated ICP and company information
- Properly secured with authentication checks
- Server-side logging for debugging

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  runs: [
    {
      id: string,
      status: string,
      totalProspects: number,
      completed: number,
      createdAt: string,
      completedAt: string | null,
      icp: {
        id: string,
        title: string,
        company: {
          name: string | null,
          domain: string
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Component

**Location:** `src/app/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`

**New Features:**

#### Status Badges
- **Completed** - Default badge variant (blue)
- **Processing** - Secondary badge variant (gray)
- **Pending** - Outline badge variant
- **Failed** - Destructive badge variant (red)

#### Progress Display
- Shows `completed/totalProspects` for all runs
- Displays percentage progress for PROCESSING runs
- Example: "5/10 prospects" with "50% complete"

#### Time Formatting
- Relative time display for better UX
- "Just now" - Less than 1 minute
- "X mins ago" - Less than 60 minutes
- "X hours ago" - Less than 24 hours
- "X days ago" - Less than 7 days
- Full date - Older than 7 days

#### UI Enhancements
- Hover effects on run cards
- Truncated text for long ICP titles
- Responsive layout with flex containers
- Direct "View Results" button for each run
- Empty state with call-to-action

#### Error Handling
- Client-side console logging for API failures
- Server-side logging for debugging
- Graceful error display to users

## Database Structure

The feature leverages existing database models:

- **QualificationRun** - Stores run metadata and status
- **ICP** - Links runs to Ideal Customer Profiles
- **Company** - Links ICPs to companies
- **ProspectQualification** - Individual prospect results (not displayed in recent activity)

## User Experience Flow

1. User logs into dashboard
2. Dashboard fetches companies and recent runs in parallel
3. Recent Activity section displays:
   - Up to 10 most recent runs
   - Color-coded status badges
   - Progress information
   - Relative timestamps
   - Quick access to detailed results
4. If no runs exist, shows empty state with "Start Your First Run" button

## Data Display Logic

**Recent Activity shows:**
- ✅ Qualification runs (not individual prospect qualifications)
- ✅ All statuses (completed, processing, pending, failed)
- ✅ Runs are user-specific (only shows current user's runs)
- ✅ Ordered by creation date (newest first)

**The 3 prospect qualifications mentioned in the database are:**
- Individual prospect scoring results (shopify.com, woocommerce.com)
- These are nested under qualification runs
- Not displayed directly in Recent Activity
- Accessible via "View Results" button on each run

## Testing Notes

**Database Verification:**
- 4 qualification runs exist for user `giovanizaghinogueira@gmail.com`
- 0 qualification runs for user `test@example.com`
- API correctly filters by authenticated user

**Authentication:**
- API returns 401 Unauthorized if not logged in
- Dashboard only shows data for authenticated user
- No cross-user data leakage

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for v2:
- Real-time updates using WebSockets or polling
- Filter by status (show only completed/failed/processing)
- Pagination for users with many runs
- Export recent activity to CSV
- Bulk actions (delete multiple runs)
- Search/filter by ICP or company
- Chart/graph visualization of activity over time
