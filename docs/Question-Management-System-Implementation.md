## üéØ Key Algorithms

### Adaptive Question Selection
```typescript
// Selects questions based on user performance history
// Adjusts difficulty distribution dynamically
// Prioritizes learning objectives
adaptiveQuestionSelection(questions, userLevel, performance)
```

### Difficulty Validation
```typescript
// Analyzes content complexity
// Validates against question type expectations
// Provides improvement suggestions
validateDifficulty(content, type, assignedDifficulty)
```

### Quality Analytics
```typescript
// Calculates discrimination index
// Tracks difficulty accuracy
// Generates improvement recommendations
analyzeQuestionQuality(questionResults, userPerformance)
```

## üìà Analytics Capabilities

### Question Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of users answering correctly
- **Average Time**: Time spent on question
- **Difficulty Accuracy**: How well assigned difficulty matches performance
- **Discrimination Index**: How well question differentiates skill levels

### Trend Analysis
- 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day performance trends
- Usage pattern analysis
- Quality deterioration detection
- Performance prediction models

### Recommendations Engine
- Automatic difficulty adjustment suggestions
- Question retirement recommendations
- Content improvement suggestions
- Category rebalancing alerts

## üîß Configuration Options

### Question Selection Config
```typescript
{
  totalQuestions: number,
  difficultyDistribution: Record<DifficultyLevel, number>,
  categoryWeights: Record<string, number>,
  adaptiveSelection: boolean,
  userLevel: DifficultyLevel,
  excludePrevious: boolean
}
```

### Validation Settings
```typescript
{
  contentComplexityThreshold: number,
  difficultyToleranceLevel: number,
  qualityScoreMinimum: number,
  autoRetirementThreshold: number
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Question Selection
```typescript
const selectedQuestions = await questionBankService.selectQuestions({
  qualificationId: "qual_123",
  totalQuestions: 30,
  difficultyDistribution: {
    BEGINNER: 0.3,
    INTERMEDIATE: 0.4,
    ADVANCED: 0.25,
    EXPERT: 0.05
  }
});
```

### Adaptive Selection
```typescript
const adaptiveQuestions = await questionBankService.selectQuestions({
  qualificationId: "qual_123",
  totalQuestions: 30,
  adaptiveSelection: true,
  userLevel: DifficultyLevel.INTERMEDIATE,
  previousAttempts: ["q1", "q2", "q3"]
});
```

### Question Validation
```typescript
const validation = QuestionContentValidator.validateContent({
  title: "Advanced React Patterns",
  content: "Explain the benefits of...",
  type: QuestionType.ESSAY,
  options: { wordLimit: { min: 200, max: 500 } }
});
```

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexing and selective field retrieval
2. **Caching**: Question metadata cached for faster selection
3. **Batch Operations**: Analytics updates processed in batches
4. **Lazy Loading**: Question content loaded on-demand
5. **Query Optimization**: Complex analytics queries optimized for performance

## üîí Security & Validation

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
2. **Authentication**: Admin/Instructor roles required for question management
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of selection and analytics endpoints
4. **Data Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before processing
5. **Access Control**: Question access based on qualification permissions
