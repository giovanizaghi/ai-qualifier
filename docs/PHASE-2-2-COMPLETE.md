# Phase 2.2 Implementation Complete: Run State Management

## üéØ Overview

Phase 2.2 of the Business Logic Bugs implementation is now complete. This phase focused on implementing comprehensive qualification run state management with timeout handling, stuck run recovery, cleanup mechanisms, and health monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Components

### 1. QualificationRunManager Class
**File:** `src/lib/qualification-run-manager.ts`

**Features:**
- **Timeout Handling**: Automatic detection and handling of runs that exceed configured timeout
- **Stuck Run Recovery**: Intelligent recovery that can resume or fail runs based on progress
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health status for all active runs
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old completed/failed runs
- **Configurable**: Customizable timeout, check intervals, and retry limits

**Key Methods:**
- `checkTimeouts()`: Check for and handle timed out runs
- `recoverStuckRuns()`: Comprehensive recovery for startup scenarios
- `getRunHealthStatus()`: Get health status for all active runs
- `failRun()`: Manually fail a specific run
- `resumeRun()`: Attempt to resume a stuck run
- `cleanup()`: Clean up old runs
- `getStats()`: Get manager statistics

### 2. Enhanced API Routes

#### Updated `/api/qualify/[runId]` 
**File:** `src/app/api/qualify/[runId]/route.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- **GET**: Now includes health status information from run manager
- **PUT**: New management endpoint for resuming/failing runs
- **DELETE**: Existing deletion functionality maintained

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Resume a stuck run
curl -X PUT /api/qualify/run-123 -d '{"action": "resume"}'

# Manually fail a run
curl -X PUT /api/qualify/run-123 -d '{"action": "fail", "reason": "User cancelled"}'
```

#### New Health Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/qualify/[runId]/health/route.ts`

- Get detailed health status for a specific run
- Returns progress, age, stuck status, and estimated completion time

#### New Management Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/qualify/management/route.ts`

**Features:**
- **GET**: Manager statistics and active run overview
- **POST**: Perform management actions (recover, checkTimeouts, cleanup)

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Get manager statistics
curl /api/qualify/management

# Perform recovery
curl -X POST /api/qualify/management -d '{"action": "recover"}'

# Cleanup old runs
curl -X POST /api/qualify/management -d '{"action": "cleanup", "olderThanDays": 7}'
```

### 3. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**New Fields Added:**
```prisma
model QualificationRun {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Run management fields
  retryCount       Int      @default(0)
  lastErrorMessage String?  @db.Text
  timeoutAt        DateTime? // When this run should timeout
  updatedAt        DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Unit Tests
**File:** `src/lib/__tests__/qualification-run-manager.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Timeout detection and handling
- ‚úÖ Stuck run recovery scenarios
- ‚úÖ Health status reporting
- ‚úÖ Run resume functionality
- ‚úÖ Run failure handling
- ‚úÖ Cleanup operations
- ‚úÖ Statistics generation
- ‚úÖ Error handling scenarios

**Coverage Areas:**
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases (runs not found, database errors)
- Different run states and progress levels
- Mock external dependencies

### 5. Enhanced Recovery Script
**File:** `scripts/qualification-run-manager.ts`

**Features:**
- **Multiple Actions**: recover, checkTimeouts, cleanup, stats, health
- **Check-Only Mode**: Preview changes without making them
- **Verbose Output**: Detailed logging and progress information
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable timeouts and parameters

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Basic recovery
npm run run-manager

# Check health status
npm run run-manager -- --action health --verbose

# Cleanup old runs
npm run run-manager -- --action cleanup --days 7

# Check what would be recovered (dry run)
npm run run-manager -- --action recover --check-only
```

### 6. Application Integration
**File:** `src/lib/startup.ts`

**Integration Points:**
- **Automatic Startup**: Run manager starts with the application
- **Recovery on Boot**: Automatically recovers stuck runs on startup  
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly stops run manager on application shutdown
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous background monitoring

## üîß Configuration Options

The run manager supports flexible configuration:

```typescript
interface RunTimeoutConfig {
  timeoutMinutes: number;      // Default: 30
  checkIntervalMinutes: number; // Default: 5  
  maxRetries: number;          // Default: 2
}
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Health Status Information
Each active run provides:
- **Progress**: Percentage complete
- **Age**: How long the run has been active
- **Stuck Status**: Whether the run is considered stuck
- **ETA**: Estimated time remaining (when calculable)

### Manager Statistics
- Active runs (pending vs processing)
- Recent completion/failure counts
- Success rates
- Configuration details

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Automatic recovery of stuck runs prevents indefinite hanging
2. **Observability**: Clear visibility into run health and progress
3. **Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup prevents database bloat
4. **User Experience**: Faster resolution of stuck runs
5. **Operational**: Easy manual management through scripts and APIs

## üîÑ How It Works

### Automatic Timeout Detection
1. Run manager checks active runs every 5 minutes (configurable)
2. Identifies runs older than timeout threshold (30 minutes default)
3. Determines whether to retry or fail based on progress made
4. Takes appropriate action (resume or mark as failed)

### Stuck Run Recovery  
1. On application startup, scans for all active runs
2. Evaluates each run's health and age
3. Recovers runs that can be resumed
4. Fails runs that exceed retry limits
5. Provides detailed logging of all actions taken

### Health Monitoring
1. Real-time tracking of run progress and status
2. Estimation of completion times based on current progress
3. Detection of runs that haven't made recent progress
4. Comprehensive statistics for operational monitoring

## üß™ Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- **State Management**: All run state transitions
- **Error Scenarios**: Database failures, missing runs, etc.
- **Recovery Logic**: Different recovery scenarios and decisions
- **API Integration**: Mock testing of external dependencies
- **Configuration**: Different timeout and retry configurations

## üìù Next Steps

Phase 2.2 is complete. The implementation provides a robust foundation for run state management that addresses the critical issues identified in the Business Logic Bugs document:

- ‚úÖ **Async Processing State Management**: Runs can no longer get stuck indefinitely
- ‚úÖ **Background Processing Logic**: Proper separation and timeout handling
- ‚úÖ **Data Consistency**: Enhanced validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health and statistics reporting

The system is now ready for production use with automatic recovery, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities.
