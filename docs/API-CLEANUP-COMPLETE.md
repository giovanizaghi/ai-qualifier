│   │   └── route.ts               NextAuth handler
│   └── register/
│       └── route.ts               User registration
├── companies/                     ✅ NEW (Phase 3)

│       └── route.ts               GET/DELETE: Company details
└── qualify/                       ✅ NEW (Phase 3)
    ├── route.ts                   POST: Start qualification
    └── [runId]/
        ├── route.ts               GET/DELETE: Run status

## 🔄 Migration Impact

### Frontend Impact
The following frontend components will need updates (Phase 4):
- ❌ Assessment-related pages
- ❌ Question-related pages
- ❌ Old qualification pages
- ❌ Old dashboard components

These will be replaced with:
- ✅ Onboarding flow (domain input)
- ✅ ICP management dashboard
- ✅ Qualification interface
- ✅ Results display

### Database Impact
- ✅ **No impact** - Old models already removed in Phase 1
- ✅ **Schema is clean** - Only new ICP models exist

### Service/Library Impact
- ✅ **No impact** - Old services already removed in Phase 2
- ✅ **New services working** - Phase 2 services integrated

---

## ✅ Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# Result: ✓ Compiled successfully
```

### Route Count
```bash
find src/app/api -name "route.ts" -type f | wc -l
# Result: 8 routes (correct)
```

### Directory Structure
```bash
ls -la src/app/api/
# Result: auth/, companies/, qualify/ (clean)
```

2. **Register Route**: Kept user registration endpoint
3. **Clean Separation**: Old and new systems completely separated
4. **No Dependencies**: Removing old routes didn't break anything
5. **Build Success**: Zero compilation errors after cleanup
