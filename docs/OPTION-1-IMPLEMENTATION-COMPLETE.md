# ✅ Option 1 Implementation Complete: Automatic Stuck Run Recovery

## What Was Implemented

Automatic recovery mechanism that marks stuck qualification runs as FAILED when the server starts.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. ✅ `src/instrumentation.ts` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Runs automatically when Next.js server starts

**Features**:
- Checks for stuck runs on every server start
- Uses 5-minute timeout (aggressive for development)
- Logs recovery actions
- Never blocks server startup

**Output Example**:
```
[Instrumentation] Server starting...
[Instrumentation] Checking for stuck qualification runs...
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a: PROCESSING, 0/1, age: 10min
[Recovery] Found 1 stuck runs (older than 5 minutes)
[Recovery] Marked 1 runs as FAILED
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered 1 stuck runs
  - Run cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a: 0/1 completed (status: PROCESSING → FAILED)
[Instrumentation] Server initialization complete
```

### 2. ✅ `src/lib/background-recovery.ts` (ENHANCED)
**Purpose**: Core recovery logic

**Improvements**:
- Lists ALL active runs for debugging
- Shows age of each run
- Detailed logging
- Returns recovered runs list

**Functions**:
- `recoverStuckRuns(timeoutMinutes)` - Mark old runs as failed
- `getStuckRuns(timeoutMinutes)` - Query without modifying
- `resumeQualificationRun(runId)` - Placeholder for future

### 3. ✅ `next.config.ts` (UNCHANGED)
Next.js 15 has instrumentation enabled by default - no changes needed!

## How It Works

              Server Ready ✅
```

## Configuration

### Timeout Setting
**Current**: 5 minutes (development-friendly)

**To change**:
```typescript
// In src/instrumentation.ts
const result = await recoverStuckRuns(5); // Change this number
```

**Recommendations**:
- **Development**: 5 minutes (fast feedback)
- **Staging**: 15 minutes (moderate)
- **Production**: 30 minutes (conservative)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: No Stuck Runs
```
[Recovery] No runs older than 5 minutes found
[Instrumentation] ✅ No stuck runs found
```

### Test Case 2: Stuck Run Found ✅ (VERIFIED)
```
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a: PROCESSING, 0/1, age: 10min
[Recovery] Found 1 stuck runs (older than 5 minutes)
[Recovery] Marked 1 runs as FAILED
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered 1 stuck runs
```

### Test Case 3: Recent Run (Not Stuck)
```
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - xyz123: PROCESSING, 3/10, age: 2min
[Recovery] No runs older than 5 minutes found
```
Run continues to show in notifier (it's actually running!)

## Benefits

### ✅ Automatic
- No manual intervention needed
- Runs on every server start
- Catches all stuck runs from previous sessions

### ✅ Safe
- Never blocks server startup
- Errors are caught and logged
- Only affects old runs (5+ minutes)

### ✅ Visible
- Clear logging of actions taken
- Lists all active runs for debugging
- Shows age and progress of runs

### ✅ Development-Friendly
- 5-minute timeout = quick cleanup
- Helpful for rapid testing
- No stuck notifications after restart

## What Happens to Stuck Runs

1. **Status**: PROCESSING → FAILED
2. **Timestamp**: `completedAt` set to now
3. **Visibility**: Disappears from active run notifier
4. **History**: Appears in user's history as failed
5. **Data**: Partial results (if any) are preserved

## Limitations

⚠️ **This does NOT**:
- Resume interrupted qualifications
- Retry failed prospects
- Preserve in-progress analysis
- Save unsaved results

✅ **This DOES**:
- Clean up stuck database records
- Remove stale notifications
- Provide clean state after restart
- Prevent user confusion

## User Experience

### Before (Without Recovery):
1. User starts qualification
2. Server restarts
3. ❌ Notification shows forever
4. ❌ Status stuck at "PROCESSING"
5. ❌ User confused - nothing happening

### After (With Recovery): ✅
1. User starts qualification
2. Server restarts
3. ✅ Automatic cleanup on startup
4. ✅ Run marked as FAILED
5. ✅ Notification disappears
6. ✅ User can retry

## Logs You'll See

Every time you start the server:

```bash
[Instrumentation] Server starting...
[Instrumentation] Checking for stuck qualification runs...

# If stuck runs found:
[Recovery] Found 2 active run(s) in database:
  - run1: PROCESSING, 5/10, age: 12min
  - run2: PROCESSING, 0/5, age: 8min
[Recovery] Found 2 stuck runs (older than 5 minutes)
[Recovery] Marked 2 runs as FAILED
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered 2 stuck runs
  - Run run1: 5/10 completed (status: PROCESSING → FAILED)
  - Run run2: 0/5 completed (status: PROCESSING → FAILED)

[Instrumentation] Server initialization complete
```

## Additional Tools Available

While automatic recovery handles most cases, you also have:

### 1. Manual CLI Script
```bash
npm run recover-stuck-runs
```

### 2. API Endpoint
```bash
GET  /api/qualify/recovery  # Check stuck runs
POST /api/qualify/recovery  # Recover manually
```

### 3. Direct Database Query
```sql
UPDATE qualification_runs
SET status = 'FAILED', completedAt = NOW()
WHERE status = 'PROCESSING'
  AND createdAt < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

## Monitoring

### Check Active Runs Anytime
```bash
# Start server and look for this log:
[Recovery] Found X active run(s) in database:
  - runId: STATUS, completed/total, age: Xmin
```

### Verify Recovery Working
```bash
# After server restart, should see:
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered X stuck runs
```

## Next Steps

### For Development: ✅ DONE!
- Automatic recovery working
- 5-minute timeout appropriate
- Clear logging for debugging

### For Production (Future):
Consider implementing a proper job queue:
- **BullMQ + Redis** (most robust)
- **Inngest** (easiest, serverless)
- **Trigger.dev** (great DX)

See `docs/BACKGROUND-TASKS-PERSISTENCE.md` for details.

## Summary

✅ **Automatic recovery is now active!**

Every time you restart the server:
1. Checks for stuck runs
2. Marks old runs (5+ min) as FAILED
3. Logs actions taken
4. Notifier shows clean state

No more manual cleanup needed! 🎉
