# 🎉 Automatic Stuck Run Recovery - Summary

## What You Asked For
> "let's start by the recommended, Option 1: Mark as Failed (Recommended)"

## What Was Delivered ✅

### Automatic Recovery System
Every time you restart the server, stuck qualification runs are automatically cleaned up!

### Test Results (Just Now!)
```
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a: PROCESSING, 0/1, age: 10min
[Recovery] Found 1 stuck runs (older than 5 minutes)
[Recovery] Marked 1 runs as FAILED
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered 1 stuck runs
```

**Result**: The notification that was appearing is now gone! ✅

## How It Works

1. **Server Starts** → Instrumentation hook runs
2. **Queries Database** → Finds runs in PROCESSING/PENDING
3. **Checks Age** → Identifies runs older than 5 minutes
4. **Marks as Failed** → Updates status and timestamp
5. **Logs Actions** → Clear visibility of what happened
6. **Server Ready** → Clean state, no stuck runs!

## Files Created

1. ✅ `src/instrumentation.ts` - Runs on server start
2. ✅ `src/lib/background-recovery.ts` - Recovery logic (enhanced)
3. ✅ `src/app/api/qualify/recovery/route.ts` - API endpoint
4. ✅ `scripts/recover-stuck-runs.ts` - CLI tool

## Configuration

**Current Setting**: 5 minutes (development-friendly)

**To Adjust**:
```typescript
// In src/instrumentation.ts, line 14:
const result = await recoverStuckRuns(5); // Change this number
```

**Recommended Timeouts**:
- Development: 5 minutes ⚡ (current)
- Staging: 15 minutes
- Production: 30 minutes

## What Happens Now

### Before Restart:
- Qualification running → Server crashes/restarts
- Run stuck in PROCESSING status
- Notification shows forever
- User confused

### After Restart (Now): ✅
- Server starts
- Automatic check runs
- Stuck run found and marked FAILED
- Notification disappears
- Clean state!

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start
```bash
npm run dev

# Output:
[Instrumentation] Checking for stuck qualification runs...
[Recovery] No runs older than 5 minutes found
[Instrumentation] ✅ No stuck runs found
```

### Scenario 2: Stuck Run Cleanup ✅ (Just Tested!)
```bash
npm run dev

# Output:
[Instrumentation] Checking for stuck qualification runs...
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a: PROCESSING, 0/1, age: 10min
[Recovery] Found 1 stuck runs (older than 5 minutes)
[Recovery] Marked 1 runs as FAILED
[Instrumentation] ✅ Recovered 1 stuck runs
```

### Scenario 3: Recent Run (Still Processing)
```bash
npm run dev

# Output:
[Recovery] Found 1 active run(s) in database:
  - xyz123: PROCESSING, 3/10, age: 2min
[Recovery] No runs older than 5 minutes found
```
Notification stays visible (run is actually running!)

## Additional Tools (Still Available)

### 1. Manual CLI Recovery
```bash
npm run recover-stuck-runs           # Recover all
npm run recover-stuck-runs -- --check-only  # Check only
npm run recover-stuck-runs -- --timeout=60  # Custom timeout
```

### 2. API Endpoints
```bash
GET  /api/qualify/recovery?timeout=30  # Check
POST /api/qualify/recovery             # Recover
```

### 3. Direct Database
```sql
-- Check stuck runs
SELECT id, status, createdAt FROM qualification_runs
WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'PROCESSING')
  AND createdAt < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';

-- Mark as failed
UPDATE qualification_runs
SET status = 'FAILED', completedAt = NOW()
WHERE status = 'PROCESSING'
  AND createdAt < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Automatic
- Zero manual intervention
- Runs every server start
- Catches all stuck runs

### ✅ Fast
- 5-minute timeout
- Instant cleanup on restart
- No waiting

### ✅ Visible
- Clear logging
- Shows all active runs
- Reports actions taken

### ✅ Safe
- Never blocks startup
- Errors caught and logged
- Only affects old runs

## Limitations

This solution:
- ✅ Cleans up stuck runs automatically
- ✅ Removes stale notifications
- ✅ Provides clean state after restart
- ❌ Does NOT resume interrupted work
- ❌ Does NOT retry failed prospects
- ❌ Does NOT persist across restarts

For production with task persistence, see:
- `docs/BACKGROUND-TASKS-PERSISTENCE.md` - Full options
- BullMQ + Redis (recommended)
- Inngest (easiest)
- Trigger.dev (great DX)

## Testing Confirmed ✅

**Test Run**: `cmgz47wkm0005on6t8hxo4b9a`
- **Before**: PROCESSING status, 10 minutes old, notification showing
- **Action**: Server restarted
- **After**: FAILED status, notification gone, clean state

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE AND WORKING**

The notification you were seeing is now automatically cleaned up on server restart!
