# Navigation Menu Fixes - October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Borders Appearing on All Elements
**Problem:** All elements in the application had borders that shouldn't be there.

**Root Cause:** The `globals.css` file had a duplicate `@layer base` section with this code:
```css
@layer base {
  * {
    border-color: var(--color-border);  /* This was applying borders to ALL elements */
    outline-color: var(--color-ring);
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Removed the duplicate `@layer base` section that was applying `border-color` to all elements (`*` selector).

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/globals.css` - Removed lines 114-126 (duplicate @layer base with border styling)

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Async Component Error in Dashboard
**Problem:** Console error: "Navbar is an async Client Component. Only Server Components can be async"

**Root Cause:** The `(authenticated)/layout.tsx` was a synchronous function but was trying to render the async `Navbar` component.

**Solution:** Made the layout function async to properly handle the async Navbar component.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` - Changed from `export default function` to `export default async function`

---

## Final Implementation

### Layout File (Correctly Async)
```tsx
// src/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx
import { Navbar } from "@/components/shared"

export default async function AuthenticatedLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Navbar Component (Server Component with Auth)
```tsx
// src/components/shared/navbar.tsx
export async function Navbar() {
  const session = await auth()  // Server-side auth check
  // ... render logic
}
```

---

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - No errors
- All routes compiling correctly
- All authenticated pages (/dashboard, /qualify, /companies, /onboarding) working
- Navbar renders properly on all authenticated pages
- No unwanted borders on any elements

---

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Async server components can be used in async layouts
2. **Proper Auth Flow**: Auth is checked at layout level, before page content loads
3. **No Border Issues**: Clean styling without unintended global CSS rules
4. **Route Organization**: Clear (authenticated) route group for logged-in pages

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/globals.css` - Removed duplicate @layer base with borders
2. `src/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` - Made layout async

## Notes

- CSS warnings about `@apply`, `@theme`, and `@custom-variant` are normal for Tailwind CSS v4 and don't affect functionality
- ESLint warnings (import order, unused vars) are style warnings, not errors
- The navbar is now properly implemented as a layout component following Next.js 15 best practices
