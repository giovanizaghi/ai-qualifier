## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration (48 hours before)
- [ ] Create complete backup of all systems
- [ ] Validate migration scripts in staging
- [ ] Confirm rollback procedures
- [ ] Test data validation scripts
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

### Migration Day
- [ ] Execute database migration
- [ ] Run content migration scripts
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Test critical functionality
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Confirm user access

### Post-Migration (24 hours after)
- [ ] Monitor system stability
- [ ] Validate user experience
- [ ] Check data analytics
- [ ] Confirm backup systems
- [ ] Document any issues
- [ ] Communicate completion

---

## Data Validation Scripts

### Database Validation
```sql
-- Validate user data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) as profile_count FROM user_profiles;

-- Validate question data
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as question_count 
FROM questions 
GROUP BY category;

-- Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_progress up 
LEFT JOIN users u ON up.user_id = u.id 
WHERE u.id IS NULL;
```

### Content Validation
```bash
# Validate image files
find ./public/images -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.png" | wc -l

# Check file permissions
find ./uploads -type f -not -perm 644 -ls

# Validate JSON configuration files
find ./config -name "*.json" -exec node -c {} \;
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Database Rollback
1. Stop application services
2. Restore database from backup
3. Validate data integrity
4. Restart services
5. Test critical functions

### Content Rollback
1. Revert to previous content version
2. Clear CDN cache
3. Validate content accessibility
4. Test user experience

### Application Rollback
1. Deploy previous application version
2. Restore configuration files
3. Restart all services
4. Monitor system health
